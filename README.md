The application is designed as a Traffic Monitoring System, in which, by using a TCP client-server model, the clients could connect to the server and authenticate to gain speed data, and limitations and report traffic events. Using multithreading, the client’s communication to the server follows a TCP protocol in three concurrent threads that determine the client’s speed, traffic events reported by other clients, and the client’s input.
